Inputs
------

1) **Music Database**

   The Music Database is the set of songs you want to generate recommendations
   from. Initally you define how a :term:`Song` looks like, i.e. you define it
   has an ``artist``, ``album`` and ``title`` field for example. 

   A single :term:`Song` can actually have more attributes than these, but only 
   those three would be used by the computation.

2) **Listen History**

   The second input is the **Listen History**. In contrast to the **Music
   Database** it is optional (*). 

   (*) Although you effectively disable libmunins main feature this way.
