I wrote my bachelor thesis on *libmunin*. Therefore there are two quite detailed
papers on how it works around. The first one is the project report.  It gives a
overview on what the library can do, how it's designed and some other details.
The other one is the bachelor thesis, which describes the algorithms in detail
(as of today, 15.4.2014). Future versions of *libmunin* might use other
algorithms, the papers will not be updated.  Sadly, you gonna need an
understanding of german to read the papers.
